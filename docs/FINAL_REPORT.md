# Multi-role implementation report — 2026-10-02

## 1. What was built

SkillSetu now supports exactly Data Analyst, Python Developer and Java Developer through one complete diagnose → gap plan → learning → practice → reassessment → report journey. There are 51 skill nodes/lessons, 204 practice checks, 18 workplace cases with 144 scored actions, three fictional employer profiles and three separate fictional cohorts.

## 2. Architecture changes

Public role metadata and server-side track registration replace Data Analyst-specific queries and screen labels. The existing scoring, prerequisite planning, mastery, comparison and reporting engines serve all tracks. A persisted role selector preserves independent progress and unfinished attempts. APIs scope content and evidence to the current role, require a role-specific baseline, and reject stale/cross-role operations. A new immutable migration defaults legacy learners/cohorts to Data Analyst. Hosted migrations commit schema and checksum atomically.

## 3. Python Developer

17 nodes cover values/control flow, functions/scope, structures, comprehensions, modules/environments, OOP/composition, exceptions, files, debugging, tests, HTTP/JSON, SQL, refactoring, reasoning, clarification, communication and backend boundaries. Each has an original worked lesson and four practice checks (68 total), including a harder application. Diagnostic cases repair an order processor, supplier API integration and dispatch script; different reassessments use log import, reservation API and customer automation. Each bank has 24 mapped actions and stakeholder follow-ups. A fictional junior Python profile supplies independent targets.

## 4. Java Developer

18 nodes cover types/control flow/methods, classes/encapsulation, interfaces/polymorphism/composition, collections, iteration, generics, exceptions, String semantics, files, debugging, unit tests, JDBC, REST/layers, refactoring, build packages/dependencies, reasoning, clarification and communication. There are 72 original practice checks. Diagnostic cases repair orders, dispatch collection logic and a backend controller; different reassessments use payment retries, inventory reconciliation and customer API/import. Each bank has 24 mapped actions. A fictional junior Java profile supplies independent targets.

## 5. Data Analyst regression status

The original graph, diagnostic/reassessment banks, lessons and pure engine files are unchanged from the founder-selected repository. Legacy assessment/lesson/question IDs stay stable. Existing learners and assessments survive repeated migration/seed. All original 18 unit/integration and three browser tests remain and pass. Shared UI changes add selection and dynamic role labels without replacing the original journey.

## 6. Verification

40 Vitest tests cover all banks and skill mappings, prerequisite graphs, actual-response grading, independent histories, lesson/mastery rules, alternate reassessment declines, employer requirements, cohorts, ownership/public projections and legacy/libSQL migration safety. Typecheck, ESLint and production build pass. Six production Playwright journeys cover all three roles, both learning modes, hints/mastery, switching/resume, honest improvement and decline, role-correct reports/PDFs, cohorts, mobile layout, keyboard input and invalid API requests. A source-only clean copy installed dependencies, ran setup twice and built successfully. Fresh production entry, persisted-answer reload/resume and cohorts also passed for all roles in that clean copy. Report/mobile screenshots were visually inspected.

## 7. Known limits

Choices measure applied recognition and decisions, not unrestricted code authoring. Code excerpts are not executed. There is no voice, avatar, 3D or active AI grading. Evidence per node is limited; banks and practice are fixed; prototype thresholds are not scientifically validated employment predictions. Cookies are demo access, not production identity. Cohorts/employers are fictional. Real hosted credentials and deployment are not verified here; existing libSQL support and Vercel durability guard remain intact.

## 8. Pending founder questions

None block this implementation. Approved defaults retain separate progress and prohibit automatic cross-role credit. Public hosting and real-student rollout require separate infrastructure/identity decisions; local demonstration is complete.

## 9. How to demo each role

Download/extract the complete ZIP, install Node.js 24, and double-click `start-skillsetu.cmd` on Windows (or use `bash start-skillsetu.sh`). Keep the terminal open and use its localhost address. Select a role before entering the student demo. Complete three stakeholder cases, review role-specific gaps, practice a recommended lesson in either mode, then take the alternate cases and inspect the report. Use Target role to switch without losing progress. Placement dashboard → Cohort role changes the separate fictional sample. Full setup and hosting instructions are in README.

## 10. Next real-world validation

Pilot a chosen track with 20–30 junior learners, a placement officer and a role-appropriate practitioner. Review scenario/rubric credibility, measure baseline, lesson completion and reassessment, then use independently scored fresh coding/analysis tasks to test transfer beyond familiarity with fixed choices. Do not treat early results as proven hiring outcomes.
